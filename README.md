# TSat

Try and develop a python based satellite prediction program.

### Why ?

I like GPredict - but it is very heavy in terms of resources. 
Plus I would like to understand the process what needs to be undertaken.


### Testing

To test the project

    python -m unittest tests/*

# Requirements

python3.7 and then the requirements.txt
